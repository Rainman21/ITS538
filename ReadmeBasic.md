The video for the lesson walks you through these concepts and points you toward online resources at W3schools.com to help you explore more...

Additionally, you can check out CodePen.io, setup an account and explore various online lab spaces to understand and experiement with various combinations of html, css and javascript (all on line!)

We conclude the online lesson by looking at the differences between SVG, PNG, JPEG and GIF formats and how they are rendored.  This gives us the opportunity to explore sites like D3JS.org to examine what they are able to accomplish with SVG, as well as compare some html5 tech such as Canvas and compare that to not only live SVG, but also SVG manipulated via CSS and the @keyframes animation paradigm.
